   <h3>File a Claim</h3>
   <p>At DSR Moving, we pride ourselves in treating your move with caution and care.  In the event that something gets damaged or lost, we will resolve the issue in the a fair and timely manner.  </p>

   <div class="divider"></div>
   <div class="section">
      <h5>Reporting a damaged or missing item.</h5>
      <p>If you feel that DSR has lost or damaged an item, please email us within 10 business days of the move at <a href="mailto:dsrmoving@gmail.com">dsrmoving@gmail.com</a> and we will send you a claim form.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="section">
      <h5>Protecting your move.</h5>
      <p> You must select your level of valuation before the move begins. Once it starts, the selection cannot be changed. Also, be sure to provide the mover with a list of items you believe to be of extraordinary value (see Articles of Extraordinary Value). While preparing that list, customers sometimes realize that they have undervalued their shipment by simply accepting the minimum required. If everything on the truck is destroyed, are you prepared to accept a check for the value of the shipment shown on the estimate? If not, talk to someone about declaring an increased amount (and paying a higher fee).   </p>

      <p>   Basic Value Protection - No Charge: Mover’s maximum liability will be $0.60 per pound based upon the weight of any lost or damaged items, regardless of its actual value. For example, damage to your refrigerator weighing 400 pounds would result in a maximum claim settlement of $240. Basic Value Protection provides minimal protection, and it is possible that settlement of any claim under this level of valuation will not be satisfactory to you. Under this type of valuation, for example, if the total weight of your shipment is 8,000 pounds, then the total value of your entire shipment is established to be $4,800.   </p>

      <p>   Full Value Protection - $0.75 Per $100 of Value: The minimum value of the shipment will be $4.00 times the weight of the shipment. However, you have the right to declare that your shipment has a greater value and pay for that increased protection. If items are lost, the mover will have the options of replacing them with articles of like kind and quality or paying the replacement cost as determined by current market value. If items are damaged, the mover will have the same options, plus the additional options of repairing the items or paying the repair cost. All damaged items that are either replaced or reimbursed at full-market value become the property of the mover. Under this type of valuation, for example, if the total weight of your shipment is 8,000 pounds, then the total value of your entire shipment is established to be $32,000 and the charge for that level of protection would be $240. However, if you decided that your shipment has a greater value, maybe $45,000 rather than the calculated minimum of $32,000, you could establish that your shipment value is $45,000 and the charge for that level of protection would be $337.50. </p>

   <div class="section">
      <h5>How are settlements determined</h5>
      <p> If you have lost or damaged items, contact your mover for a claim form. Claims will not be processed until you pay for the move in full. CLAIMS SHOULD BE FILED WITH THE MOVER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, BUT NO LATER THAN NINE MONTHS AFTER DELIVERY. DO NOT DISPOSE OF ANY DAMAGED ITEMS OR THE PACKING MATERIALS USED FOR THOSE ITEMS SINCE THEY WILL BE NEEDED FOR PROOF OF DAMAGE.
      </p>   
         <p>
   On the claim form, list all damaged and lost items, including the age, original cost, and weight as well as a description of the damage. The mover may request estimates or may send a third party to assess the damages.
      </p>   <p>
   All claims will be settled based upon the type of valuation you selected on the Bill of Lading and the Addendum to the Bill of Lading (see Valuation section above). If you are unable to resolve your claim with the mover, the Public Staff’s Transportation Rates Division (919-733-7766) is available to assist you. If the mover denies liability for all or part of your claim, you may seek legal action against the mover. However, such action must be taken within two years and one day from the date when written notice was given by the mover to you that your claim has been denied. Items believed to be stolen should be reported to the proper law enforcement authorities immediately.  </p>

      <h5>Particle Board Furniture</h5>
   <p>North Carolina is one of only four states in the nation that acknowledges the unique characteristics of ready-to-assemble furniture made from press board, particle board, or other similar engineered materials. These items are shipped unassembled from the manufacturer for assembly by the customer or the retail store. Most of this furniture is not designed with the extra structural pieces to adequately brace the unit for movement out of or into a residence and may not withstand the normal truck vibration. Assembly instructions frequently suggest that the connecting pieces (often using dowels) be glued in place. While the gluing does not significantly improve the structural integrity of the piece, it makes disassembly impossible without creating substantial, irreparable damage. You should be aware that the mover’s maximum liability on such furniture is $0.60 per pound per article or $50 per article, whichever is greater, regardless of the type of valuation you select.

      <div class="section">
      <h5>Articles of Extraordinary Value</h5>
   <p>



   Items of extraordinary value are defined as those having a value greater than $100 per pound. Such items, e.g., crystal, fur garments, antiques, etc., should be specifically listed in writing for the mover and signed for on the Bill of Lading. If not listed, the mover’s liability could be limited to $100 per pound per article (based upon the actual article weight) regardless of the valuation you selected. For example, a claim for a broken $500 collectible weighing one pound could be covered for only $100. However, if such collectible item is claimed on the inventory list as an item of extraordinary value at $500, the mover’s liability may be up to $500 if you selected Full Value Protection. But remember, even if you declare items of extraordinary value, the total value of your entire shipment is still no more than the total value that is established under the type and total amount of valuation protection you select. Keep a copy for your records of the inventory list you provide to your mover. It is highly recommended that you transport certain valuable items yourself, such as jewelry, stamp and coin collections, cash, guns, legal and medical documents, tax records, genealogy research, and other such irreplaceable items.
